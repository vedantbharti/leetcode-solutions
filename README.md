I try to solve atleast 1 question everyday and maintain my solutions here. The questions can be any of the easy, medium, hard sets.
Feel free to go through my solutions if needed, and suggest any better way to solve them.

Questions to definitely check:
1. Pascal's triangle
2. Median of 2 sorted arrays
3. Longest palindromic substring
4. Squares of a sorted array
5. First bad version
